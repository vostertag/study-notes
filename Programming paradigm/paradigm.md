## Introduction

**Programming paradigms** are a way to **classify programming languages based on their features**. Languages can be classified into **multiple paradigms**. There are four main paradigms and this note will present each one of them.

## The Imperative Paradigm

The **'first do this, next do that'** is a short phrase which really in a nutshell describes the spirit of the imperative paradigm: the program simply follows the step of commands it has been given, in the order that they have been given... 

Some programs using the imperative paradigm are: C, C++, Python, Java, Fortran, ...

## The Functional Paradigm

The Functional Programming paradigm **views all subprograms as functions in the mathematical sense-informally**, they take in arguments and return a single solution. 

Some programs using the functional paradigm are: Scheme, Clojure, Wolfram Language, ...

## The Logic Paradigm

Any program written in a logic programming language is a **set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain**. Then queries are made. The role of the computer becomes maintaining data and logical deduction. 

Some programs using the logic paradigm are:  Prolog, Answer Set Programming (ASP), Datalog, ...

## The Object-oriented Paradigm

Based on the concept of **"objects"**, which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures **can access and often modify the data fields of the object** with which they are associated.

Some programs using the object-oriented programming paradigm are:  Java, C++, C#, Python, ...

## Some other paradigms

* **Declarative** which does not state the order in which operations execute.
* **Procedural** which groups code into functions.
* **Symbolic** programming which has a particular style of syntax and grammar.
