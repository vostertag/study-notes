## Introduction

The term **SOLID** is a **mnemonic acronym** for **five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable**.

## S: Single responsibility principle

A class should have **one and only one reason to change**, meaning that a class should have only one job.

## O: Open-closed principle

Objects or entities should be **open for extension, but closed for modification**.

## L: Liskov substitution principle

Subtypes must be **substitutable for their base types**. Or, more simply: Functions that **use references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it**.

## I: Interface segregation principle

Clients **should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use**: many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

## D: Dependency inversion principle

High level modules **should not depend upon low level modules**. Rather, both should depend upon abstractions.
