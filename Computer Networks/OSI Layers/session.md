# The Session Layer ( WIP )

- - - - - - - - - - -

Sessions are like conversations that must be kept separate from the others. We have to :

set it up: assign numbers to the sessions, negotiate services, negotiate who sends the data first
maintain it: transfer data, reestablish if lost, ack receipt data
ending it: if both agrees or someone disconnects
