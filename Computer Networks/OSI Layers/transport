# The Transport Layer ( WIP )

Data in segments

TCP: Reliable (if segment lost, resent), 3way handshake (syn, syn-ack, ack)

UDP: UNreliable (no 3way handshake), no resent, but fast (cause low overhead)

Windowing : allow to adjust the amount of data sent, always ajusted over time

Buffering : routers ave memory to store segments if bandwith is not available, if overflow, segments will be dropped

Firewalls
