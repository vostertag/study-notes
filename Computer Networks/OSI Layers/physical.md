## Introduction

The purpose of the **physical layer** is to **transport bits from one machine to another**. Various physical media can be used for the actual transmission. Each one has **its own niche in terms of bandwidth, delay, cost, and ease of installation and maintenance**. Media are roughly grouped into **guided media**, such as copper wire and fiber optics, and **unguided media**, such as terrestrial wireless, satellite, and lasers through the air.

## Functions

The **Physical Layer** takes care of:

* **Transmitting** bits over a physical link between devices
* **Encoding** bits into a signal
* **Decoding** bits from a signal
* **Isolating** the circuits from one another

## Physical Links

The physical links are categorized as **cabled** or **wireless**. No matter the link, they will have to transform the bits (a digital signal) into an **analog signal** from transmission. 

Each media will have different properties that justify choosing them over any other: 

* **Bandwith**: measures the **amount of information that can flow from one place to another in a given amount of time**. Bandwidth is typically measured in kilobits per second (kbps) or megabits per second (Mbps)
* **Throughput**: Throughput is the measure of the **transfer of bits across the media over a given period of time**.
* **Goodput**: The **rate at which useful data traverses a link**. 

**Wired examples:**

* Ethernet
* USB 
* DSL

**Wireless examples:**

* Wi-Fi
* Bluetooth
* GSM

**Optical examples:**

* Fiber Optic
* IRDA (Wireless Infrared)

## Physical Topologies

It is a **way to organize the network**.
