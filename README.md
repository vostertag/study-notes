# Study Notes

## What is this?

Inspired by [jwasham](https://github.com/jwasham)'s [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university) repository, I have decided to study/review topics he advised to know for becoming a software engineer. I had one problem with it: Most of the resources are videos, which are not great for a quick review and you must pay to watch some of them. I wanted to have notes, so I decided to create some, and here they are!



This is WIP, and probably will be forever as there is always something new to learn! I'll probably also add Anki flashcards and some exercises in the future. But for now, I am focusing on creating notes.
